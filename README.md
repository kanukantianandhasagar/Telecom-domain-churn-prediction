# Telecom-domain-churn-prediction
Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecom sector using a machine learning model, and deploys the prediction system as an interactive web app using Streamlit. Churn prediction helps telecom companies retain valuable customers by identifying those likely to leave.
